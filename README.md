# YOLO-LiDAR Fusion
## Overview
This repository contains the code produced during my Master's Thesis in collaboration with the UBIX research group of the University of Luxembourgâ€™s Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust (SnT).
This thesis aimed to develop a resource-efficient model for 3D object detection utilizing LiDAR and camera sensors, tailored for autonomous vehicles with limited computational resources. An overview of the model is shown in the figure below.

## 1. Prerequisites
### Hardware
- Ideally: NVIDIA GPU such that the YOLOv8 model can be run with CUDA

### Software
- Python version between 3.8 and 3.11 (due to open3d requirements)

_Note:_ The code was developed and tested on Python 3.10. 

## 2. Setup
Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Go to the folder of your choice and clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Flavio8699/see-devops-project.git
    ```

2. Get into the working directory (root directory of the repository):

    ```shell
    cd YOLO-LiDAR-Fusion
    ```

3. Optionally start a virtual environment:

    ```python
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Install required libraries:

    ```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
